## Hello, Welcome to My Matrix
You took the red pill🔴 you stayed in Wonderland, and I am showing you how deep the rabbit hole goes 🐇🕳️

Do you want to know what it is?

Go ahead and explore to discover the truth.

<h3> About Me :dark_sunglasses: </h3>
I’m Davide Marino, a coder in search of the truth. In this simulation of life, I’ve embraced the world of programming, where every line of code reveals new possibilities. Like Neo, I’m on a journey to explore, learn, and break boundaries.

I specialize in Web Development, and my goal is to build innovative projects that make an impact, one function at a time.

Just like in Matrix, I believe the code is everywhere. It’s in the systems we interact with, the problems we solve, and the future we’re shaping.
