## Hello, Welcome to My Matrix
You took the red pill🔴 you stayed in Wonderland, and I am showing you how deep the rabbit hole goes 🐇🕳️

Do you want to know what it is?

Go ahead and explore to discover the truth.

<h2> About Me :dark_sunglasses: </h2>

<h3> I’m Davide Marino, a coder in search of the truth. </h3>

In this simulation of life, I’ve embraced the world of programming, where every line of code reveals new possibilities.

Like Neo, I’m on a journey to explore, learn, and break boundaries.

<h3>I specialize in Web Development, and my goal is to build innovative projects that make an impact, one function at a time.</h3>

Just like in Matrix, I believe the code is everywhere. It’s in the systems we interact with, the problems we solve, and the future we’re shaping.

<h2> Skills 🔧 </h2>

In this Matrix of technology, I'm still learning and discovering the building blocks that shape the digital world. Here's how I navigate through the code:

Web Development – [HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js]
As a web developer in training, I’m just beginning to uncover the secrets behind building both the frontend and backend of web applications. Much like Neo discovering the layers of the Matrix, I’m laying the foundation to create responsive, dynamic websites that seamlessly connect users with the digital world.

Data Analysis (Beginner) – [Python, Pandas, Excel, Basic Data Visualization]
In the realm of data, I’m starting to learn how to decode complex patterns and extract meaningful insights. Like Neo learning to "see" the code that powers the Matrix, I’m mastering the basics of data analysis to uncover hidden truths within datasets.
